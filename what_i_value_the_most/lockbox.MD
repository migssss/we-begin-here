this is supposed to be a secret, so lets keep this between you and me. 

Everything I valued, my whole life, crumbled away within months. I don't value much anymore, other 
than a few people and some pets as well. I don't ask for loyalty or anything crazy, either. Honesty 
is something I value in a person at the end of the day. 

Materialistic? you might have seen me carrying around a green water bottle with the Suburu logo on it. That little thing is something I hold high value at 
the moment also.
