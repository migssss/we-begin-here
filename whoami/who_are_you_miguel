I most likely will have to share this out with everyone. 

My name is Miguel Hernandez, I'm actually a jr believe it or not. I am 
currently 22 years old. I am not someone to describe myself, but most 
people would say that I am a very closed off person, humorous, caring, and 
someone that can eat an elephant alone. 

I have two dogs and two cats. Kiwi, Oreo, Max, and Belle. You think you 
can guess which is which? 

I can't really tell you much about myself other than the fact that I like 
playing games a lot because it keeps my mind occupied. Dead by daylight 
and left 4 dead 2 is the wave. While other times, just listening to GOOD music, 
reading a good book (comic or not), and going for hikes is what keeps me 
at peace.
